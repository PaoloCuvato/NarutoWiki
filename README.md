# Naruto ultimate ninja storm Wiki
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.1.4.

This project is a fan-made project focused on creating a modern, intuitive, and fully customizable wiki platform.

The application is developed using Angular 21, leveraging its latest features to ensure high performance, modularity, and a scalable architecture. The user interface is built with PrimeNG 21, a comprehensive UI component library that provides an elegant, responsive, and professional user experience.

The goal of the project is to build a dynamic and easy-to-navigate wiki with a modern design and a well-structured architecture, designed to manage content in a clear and efficient way.

As a fan-made project, it was born from a passion for technology and the desire to experiment with the full potential of the latest versions of Angular and PrimeNG, combining advanced frontend development with a strong focus on user experience.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
